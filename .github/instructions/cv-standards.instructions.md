# CV Standards for Professional Employment

## Overview
This document establishes the standards for creating employment-ready CVs that are optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and human readability. These standards are derived from analysis of successful CVs from candidates hired at top-tier tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon.

## Core Principles

### 1. Maximum Legibility
**Purpose**: Hiring managers spend 6-10 seconds scanning a CV. Every element must be instantly readable.

**Standards**:
- Pure black text (#000000 or RGB 0,0,0) for maximum contrast
- No colored backgrounds or fancy graphics
- Clean, professional fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Calibri)
- Sufficient white space between sections
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 2. ATS Compatibility
**Purpose**: 75% of CVs are filtered by ATS before reaching human eyes.

**Standards**:
- Simple formatting with no tables, text boxes, or columns
- Standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Keywords matching job descriptions
- No images, headers/footers, or complex layouts
- PDF format for final submission

### 3. Quantified Achievements
**Purpose**: Numbers validate impact and separate senior from junior candidates.

**Standards**:
- Every achievement must include metrics when possible
- Use percentages, absolute numbers, time frames
- Bold key metrics for quick scanning
- Focus on business impact, not just technical tasks

## Typography Standards

reduced production bugs by 45% through testing infrastructure, and decreased 
runtime errors by 60% via company-wide TypeScript adoption.
```

### Skills Section

#### Organization
1. **Soft Skills** (listed first)
   - Leadership abilities
   - People management
   - Communication skills
   - Problem-solving approaches

2. **Technical Skills** (listed second)
   - Programming languages
   - Frameworks/libraries
   - Tools and platforms
   - Methodologies

#### Formatting
- **Labels**: Bold (e.g., "Soft Skills:", "Technical Skills:")
- **List**: Comma-separated, normal weight
- **NO brackets**: "JavaScript" not "JavaScript (JS)"
- **NO proficiency levels**: Don't add "Expert" or "Proficient" labels
- **NO redundant text**: Clean, scannable lists

```

### Experience Section

#### Job Entry Format
```
[Job Title - BOLD] [Dates - RIGHT ALIGNED]
[Company Name] – Remote
• Achievement with quantified metric in bold

Bachelor's Degree, Computer Software Engineering              2015 - 2019
```

## Character Encoding Standards

### Prohibited Characters in PDF
These characters often render incorrectly or show as boxes/random symbols:

❌ **Emojis**: Any emoji (⭐, 📦, 🚀, 💻, etc.)
❌ **Special Bullets**: ▸, ►, ■, ◆
❌ **Arrows**: →, ⇒, ↔, ⟶
❌ **Checkmarks**: ✓, ✔, ✅, ☑
❌ **Mathematical**: ∈, ⊂, ∞, ≈
❌ **Typographic**: —, –, ", ", ', ' (use standard -, ", ')

✅ **Safe Characters**:
- Standard hyphen: `-`
- Standard quotes: `"` and `'`
- Pipe separator: `|`
- Standard bullet: `•` (U+2022)
- Parentheses: `()`, Brackets: `[]`
- Forward slash: `/`

### Text Encoding
- **File encoding**: UTF-8 without BOM
- **PDF encoding**: WinAnsi or built-in PDF fonts
- **Test all special characters**: Always preview PDF before submitting

## Color Standards

### Color Palette
```css
/* Primary Colors - Use Sparingly */
--color-primary: #025E73;      /* Dark Teal - for accents only */
--color-accent: #F2668B;       /* Pink - for highlights only */

/* Text Colors - Use for All Content */
--color-text: #000000;         /* Pure Black - body text */
--color-text-light: #464646;   /* Dark Gray - less important text */
--color-heading: #000000;      /* Pure Black - all headings */

/* Background Colors */
--color-background: #FFFFFF;   /* Pure White - page background */
--color-section-bg: #FAFAFA;   /* Very Light Gray - subtle sections (web only) */

/* Interactive Elements (Web Only) */
--color-link: #025E73;         /* Dark Teal - links */
--color-link-hover: #03A688;   /* Bright Teal - hover state */
```

### Color Usage Rules

#### PDF Version
- **Text**: Pure black (#000000) for ALL text
- **Backgrounds**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) only
- **Links**: Black text with simple underline
- **NO colored backgrounds**: Not even for section headers
- **NO colored text**: Black only for maximum ATS compatibility

#### Web Version
- **Text**: Pure black (#000000) for body and headings
- **Links**: Dark Teal (#025E73) with underline
- **Backgrounds**: White or very subtle gray
- **Accents**: Use sparingly for interactive elements only

### ATS-Safe Color Rules
1. Text must have 7:1 contrast ratio minimum (black on white = 21:1 ✓)
2. Never use color alone to convey information
3. Links must be identifiable by underline, not just color
4. Section headers must be recognizable by position and size, not color

## Layout Standards

### PDF Layout
```
Page Size:        A4 (210mm x 297mm)
Orientation:      Portrait
Margins:          20mm all sides
Columns:          Single column only (no multi-column)
Max Pages:        2 pages (strict requirement)
Alignment:        Left-aligned (except right-aligned dates)
```

### Web Layout
```
Max Width:        1200px (centered)
Mobile:           100% width with 1rem padding
Tablet:           90% width with 2rem padding
Desktop:          1200px with 3rem padding
Responsive:       Mobile-first approach
```

### Section Order (Standard)
1. Header (Name, Title, Contact)
2. Professional Summary
3. Skills (Soft Skills, then Technical Skills)
4. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Projects (most impressive first)
6. Education (reverse chronological)
7. Certifications (if applicable)
8. Additional Links (optional)

## Technical Implementation

### PDF Generation Settings
```typescript
{
  orientation: 'portrait',
  unit: 'mm',
  format: 'a4',
  compress: true,
  precision: 2,
  userUnit: 1.0
}
```

### Font Loading (PDF)
- Use built-in fonts: Helvetica, Times, Courier
- Avoid custom font embedding (increases file size and ATS issues)
- Helvetica is the gold standard for CVs

### Link Implementation
- **Web**: `<a>` tags with proper ARIA labels
- **PDF**: `textWithLink()` with visible underlines
- **Both**: Full URLs should be readable if printed

---

## Summary

The key to a successful CV is **maximum legibility + quantified impact + ATS compatibility**.

**Remember**:
1. **Black text, white background** - always
2. **Metrics in achievements** - every bullet point
3. **Bold the numbers** - for quick scanning
4. **No emojis or special characters** - text only
5. **2 pages maximum** - be ruthlessly concise
6. **Remote indicator** - show work flexibility
7. **Larger fonts** - 10-11pt body, not 8-9pt
8. **Proper spacing** - line height 1.5-1.6
9. **Simple format** - single column, left-aligned
10. **Test everything** - PDF must render perfectly

If in doubt, **simpler is better**. Your achievements should speak for themselves without fancy formatting.
